# BlackBerry Dynamics Android Samples

## BlackBerry Dynamics Overview



The BlackBerry Dynamics Secure Mobility Platform from BlackBerry consists of the BlackBerry Dynamics (BD) SDK services that provide a powerful set of tools to ISV and enterprise developers. It allows them to focus on building their commercial and business apps rather than learning how to secure, deploy and manage those apps.

For more information refer to the [BlackBerry Dynamics Developer Web Site](https://developers.blackberry.com/us/en/products/blackberry-dynamics/android.html).



## Samples

This repository contains sample projects that demonstrate the use of BlackBerry Dynamics APIs.  Some of these samples were created for a BlackBerry Developer Blog post, event or online session.  Samples are updated with best effort support, but not all are tested updated against each SDK release.  Note that the samples included with the BlackBerry Dynamics SDK installation are updated and verified against each SDK release.

The table below describes the main features each sample demonstrates and notes if it is actively maintained.
